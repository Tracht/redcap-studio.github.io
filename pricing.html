                If you're not sure where to start, we offer a 1 hour consultation to understand your goals, product priorities and timelines.
                We'll discuss what approaches we would recommend, suggesting the lightest weight tools to support that. 
                At the end of the call we'll recommend how we'd phase the work to meet your needs and budget.

                Pricing is subject to the complexity of the request and effort involved but to get a simple app up and running with a few screens is around €500.

            <p>Depending on how many screens and tracking events are needed, pricing will vary. As a guide, a single screen to track ±10 events is €50+. However, we do offer volume-based discounts the more screens are needed.
